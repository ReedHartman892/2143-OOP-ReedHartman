# Reflection
### 1. Does my Point2D Feel Like A Built-in Type?
I'd say so. I haven't seen a real one yet, but I suppose mine is.

### 2. What design choice most contributed to that feeling?
Overloading of several operators in relation to the Point2D function. I feel like I'm actually poking and prodding at the ends of C++. I actually feel like I'm writing useful, high-level code.

### 3. Which OOP concept currently feels most overhyped?
The friend thing. I can understand the usage in needing to make a class "friendly", to allow access to privated or protected things, but doesn't that just invalidate the whole point of private-access?

### 4. Which one feels underrated?
Operator overloading. Seems useful. I've seen the concept of overloading operators and built-in functions before, mainly with the ofString function of Java, but this worksheet raised the bar on that by a lot.

### 5. What part of this worksheet made you uncomfortable, and why?
Having to write a whole native-like type. Though it was also eye-opening because it stressed me the Hell out, and also really encapsulates the whole point of OOP. You really learn the in's and out's of a programming language by learning how to overload and override built-in functionality like this.
