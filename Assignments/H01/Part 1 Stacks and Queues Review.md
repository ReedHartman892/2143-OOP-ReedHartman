## What Are Stacks And Queues, and Arrays and Lists?
 - Stacks and Queues are abstract data types (ADTs) that define specific behaviors or data access and modification.
 - Arrays and Lists are the concrete structures used to implement stacks and queues.

# Stacks and Queues
 - Stacks: Last-in, First-out (LIFO). Elements are added (push) and removed (pop) from only one end, called the top.
 - Queues: First-in, First-out (FIFO). Elements are added (enueue) at the rear and removed (dequeue) from the front.
