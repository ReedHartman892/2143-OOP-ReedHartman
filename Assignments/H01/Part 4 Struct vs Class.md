# Struct vs Class
(Same machine code, different intent)

#### What is a Struct?
A struct (structure) is a way to group several related variables of different data types under a single name.
 - Structs seem like the 'lesser' of two evils (class is the ultimate evil.)
 - I assume they're good for smaller-scale things in a program.
 - Realistically a good candidate for a struct would be something like, a thing that has both X and Y coordinates, that also has a name. Thats two different data types associated with the same object. That would be good for a struct (I hope.)

#### What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created, combining fields (data) and methods (functions) into a single, well-encapsulated unit.
 - Classes feel like they're used to make modules in a program. Superior evil.

### What is the only language-level difference between struct and class?


### Why does C++ even allow both?


### When does choosing struct communicate intent better thn class?


### Why does intent matter more than synax in large systems?
